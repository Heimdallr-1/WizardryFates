- [`a338ea6`](https://github.com/WinDanesz/WizardryFates/commit/a338ea6c4cbe891610e59216ca7f3883ba14ae27) - The Global Discipline Mode setting is now deprecated as it was a redundant complexity. You can now directly set the "Max Main Discipline Count" and "Max Sub Discipline Count" in the settings. The max count of these are now increased to 8, which means you can max out all elements (including Ancient Spellcraft) *(commit by [@WinDanesz](https://github.com/WinDanesz))*
